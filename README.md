# Everything Dice Shop
Everything Dice Shop is a simulation of an e-commerce platform for purchasing dice. This project serves as a foundation for exploring the development of online shops, focusing on features like inventory management and user interface design. It is a work-in-progress, with several planned enhancements.

---

## Features

- [ ] Shopping Cart: Add and remove products with dynamic cart updates.
- [ ] Database Integration: Uses SQLite for data persistence.
- [ ] Flask Backend: A Python-based backend with Flask for handling server-side logic.

---

## Current Limitations
- [ ] User Authentication: Currently non-functional and in development.
- [ ] Deployment: Not yet configured for production; Kubernetes and Docker support are in progress.
- [ ] Payment System: Includes a placeholder API to simulate transactions, but no live payment integration is implemented.
